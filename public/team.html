              Late Madhavi Kapur, our Founder, also known lovingly as " ADI “ ,
              was a homegrown educationist, who believed in applying common
              sense and indigenous wisdom to the modern globalizing world. She
              worked towards building bridges between the past and the future,
              rural and urban children, the 'haves' and the 'have-nots', the
              east and the west in a healthy cross fertilization of ideas. Her
              experiments and experiences met with resounding praise from
              students and their parents who were inspired by her work.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1986, she set up her first school - S.P.M. English School in
              the city of Pune. Together with her group of professional
              educationists, she innovated with prevailing systems, adapting
              textbook theories and the latest research to the unique
              environment of urbanizing India. The year 1995 witnessed her break
              new ground when, along with her team, she took the process forward
              by establishing a more developed institution - the Rewachand
              Bhojwani Academy - which, in time, has become a relevant and
              replicable model.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2001, Ms. Kapur founded an educational trust THE MADHAVI KAPUR
              FOUNDATION - for the replication and scaling out of her work, so
              as to impact the wider educational system. She was a strong pillar
              of all the work of the Foundation and she left behind a legacy for
              us. She is fondly remembered by all and her work continues to
              impact many lives even now.

              Anjali tai began her association with Adi in 1989. She initially
              was only a parent but Adi was able to identify in her an eagerness
              to teach using Adi’s innovative and experience based teaching
              methodology, and so asked her to be a Marathi teacher. Adi didn’t
              give much importance to qualifications and degrees, rather seeking
              out people who showed an enthusiasm to teach and learn, and bought
              into her philosophies of education. Once they were part of the
              school community they were always encouraged to study further. In
              1998 Anjali tai received an award from NCERT for the teaching
              methodologies she used in her classroom with non-marathi speaking
              children.
